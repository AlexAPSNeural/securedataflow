Creating an environment variables template is an essential part of setting up and managing application configurations. Below is a basic example of an environment variables template, often stored in a `.env.example` file. This template can be used as a reference for setting up a Node.js application using dotenv or similar libraries to manage environment variables. You should adjust the variables according to your application's requirements.

```plaintext
# Database configuration
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
DB_USER=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name

# Server configuration
PORT=your_server_port
HOST=your_server_host

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# API Keys
API_KEY_GOOGLE=your_google_api_key
API_KEY_AWS=your_aws_api_key
API_SECRET_AWS=your_aws_api_secret

# Email configuration
EMAIL_HOST=your_email_host
EMAIL_PORT=your_email_port
EMAIL_USER=your_email_username
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=your_log_level

# Feature flags
FEATURE_X_ENABLED=true_or_false

# External Services
THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE_URL=your_third_party_service_url

# Development environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Notes:
- **Never commit your `.env` file to source control repositories**. Instead, use a `.gitignore` to ignore this file, and provide a `.env.example` or similar template file that doesn't contain any sensitive data.
  
- **DB Variables**: Set your specific database host, username, password, and name.
  
- **Security**: Replace `your_jwt_secret` and `your_session_secret` with secure, randomly generated strings. These are critical for maintaining security.
  
- **API and Email Configurations**: These variables are placeholders for connecting to external APIs and services like email providers. Replace with your actual keys and settings.
  
- **Logging**: Common log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
  
- **Development Environment**: `NODE_ENV` usually has values like `development`, `production`, or `test` to differentiate between different setups.


Remember to secure the environment variables using secret management tools when deploying to production environments, such as AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or similar.
